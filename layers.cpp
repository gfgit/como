 This file contains things relevant to stacking order and layers.

 Design:

 Normal unconstrained stacking order, as requested by the user (by clicking
 on windows to raise them, etc.), is in Workspace::unconstrained_stacking_order.
 That list shouldn't be used at all, except for building
 Workspace::stacking_order. The building is done
 in Workspace::constrainedStackingOrder(). Only Workspace::stackingOrder() should
 be used to get the stacking order, because it also checks the stacking order
 is up to date.
 All clients are also stored in Workspace::clients (except for isDesktop() clients,
 as those are very special, and are stored in Workspace::desktops), in the order
 the clients were created.

 Every window has one layer assigned in which it is. There are 7 layers,
 from bottom : DesktopLayer, BelowLayer, NormalLayer, DockLayer, AboveLayer, NotificationLayer,
 ActiveLayer, CriticalNotificationLayer, and OnScreenDisplayLayer (see also NETWM sect.7.10.).
 The layer a window is in depends on the window type, and on other things like whether the window
 is active. We extend the layers provided in NETWM by the NotificationLayer, OnScreenDisplayLayer,
 and CriticalNotificationLayer.
 The NoficationLayer contains notification windows which are kept above all windows except the active
 fullscreen window. The CriticalNotificationLayer contains notification windows which are important
 enough to keep them even above fullscreen windows. The OnScreenDisplayLayer is used for eg. volume
 and brightness change feedback and is kept above all windows since it provides immediate response
 to a user action.

 NET::Splash clients belong to the Normal layer. NET::TopMenu clients
 belong to Dock layer. Clients that are both NET::Dock and NET::KeepBelow
 are in the Normal layer in order to keep the 'allow window to cover
 the panel' Kicker setting to work as intended (this may look like a slight
 spec violation, but a) I have no better idea, b) the spec allows adjusting
 the stacking order if the WM thinks it's a good idea . We put all
 NET::KeepAbove above all Docks too, even though the spec suggests putting
 them in the same layer.

 Most transients are in the same layer as their mainwindow,
 see Workspace::constrainedStackingOrder(), they may also be in higher layers, but
 they should never be below their mainwindow.

 When some client attribute changes (above/below flag, transiency...),
 win::update_layer() should be called in order to make
 sure it's moved to the appropriate layer QList<X11Client *> if needed.

 Currently the things that affect client in which layer a client
 belongs: KeepAbove/Keep Below flags, window type, fullscreen
 state and whether the client is active, mainclient (transiency).

 Make sure updateStackingOrder() is called in order to make
 Workspace::stackingOrder() up to date and propagated to the world.
 Using Workspace::blockStackingUpdates() (or the StackingUpdatesBlocker
 helper class) it's possible to temporarily disable updates
 and the stacking order will be updated once after it's allowed again.
