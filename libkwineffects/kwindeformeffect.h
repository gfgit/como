 * The redirect() function must be called when the effect wants to transform a window.
 * Once the effect is no longer interested in the window, the unredirect() function
 * must be called.

 * If a window is redirected into offscreen texture, the deform() function will be
 * called with the window quads that can be mutated by the effect. The effect can
 * sub-divide, remove, or transform the window quads.
